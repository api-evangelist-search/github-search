              There are all kinds of services available today to make your
              development experience faster and less expensive. By using
              components created by other parties to perform common tasks, you
              can focus on the elements that are unique to your application. In
              effect, you’re using someone else’s code to speed up your own
              development cycle and to make maintenance less of an
              issue.Unfortunately, a major problem in using third party
              components is that their development cycles seldom match your own.

              Whether you are an API consumer or an API provider, having an API
              sandbox is a powerful way to harden any applications that use
              APIs. Creating a really great sandbox requires a few key
              considerations.

              The bottom line is that using an API sandbox reduces risks and
              costs. Development teams can deploy more confidently because
              everything is fully tested using virtual APIs to simulate a
              variety of errors. Because no one is getting in anyone else’s way,
              the project completes on time and within budget. You gain a
              competitive edge and keep it longer, which is always good for the
              bottom line.Written by: John Paul Mueller

        To further cut down on the time necessary to get the testing environment
        set up and ready to go, Prism also creates dynamically generated
        responses on the fly based on your OpenAPI specs. Essentially, a mock
        API simulates how a real API would operate.
